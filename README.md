•	There is a single main building consists of six departments. 
•	The main building has 2 floors and a ground floor.
•	The servers are situated in the ground floor of the building.
•	We have used different Servers, Routers, Switches, Access Points, Printers, IP-Phones, Personal Computers and Laptops.
•	For system connection we used CAT6 cables – RJ45 connector and for IP-Phones connection Serial DTE cable – RJ11 connector is used.
•	We have used four routers in such a way that three separate routers for each floor and one main router connected to server room located at ground floor.
•	In the network, total eight switches are used. Each floor has three departments and separate switch is allotted to that particular department. One switch is used at ground floors server room which gets connection from main router and one separate switch is used for IP-Phones connection.
•	All computers in the building are connected via CAT6 cable and the laptops are wirelessly connected to the access points. We have used three access points; each floor has one single access point covering the range of 500m.
•	We have provided printer to each department’s office and their working areas. Each floor has a conference room so the separate printer is also provided to it and at the ground floor there are only three printers are installed, one for head office, one for reception and last one for conference room.
